== Description ==
CSS3 is probably the hottest trend in web design right now but Unfortunately, it’s not a surprise that Internet Explorer, 
Implement css markup that support CSS3 "border-radius( Rounded box corners )", "box-shadow( Dropdown/Inner Shadow )" and 
"linear-gradient( Gradient background color )" in IE versions 7 to 10

This plugin add a IE support markup on main style of your theme. This markup is an IE attached behavior, when applied to an element, allows IE to recognize and display a number of CSS3 properties. This is developed by "Jason Johnston" 
he called it PIE(Progressive Internet Explorer).

The markup support numbers or CSS3 properties but this plugin can only support specific properties:
* CSS3 Transitions
Support on Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE9 +
Effect of transitions are between .2 and .3 seconds in duration, so they shouldn't cross the line between nice and distracting; however, depending on the colors used in your WP theme.

* box-shadow
* border-radius
* linear-gradient
Support for all browsers

If you have problems with the PIE behavior not being applied, check your server configuration and if possible update it to use the correct content-type. For Apache, you can do this in a .htaccess file:
- AddType text/x-component .htc
