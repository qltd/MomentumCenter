Make your website look beautiful and crisp on modern displays by creating and displaying retina images. WP 4.4+ is also supported and enhanced.

== Description ==

This plugin does two things: it creates the image files required by the High-DPI devices and it displays them to your visitors accordingly. Your website will look beautiful and crisp on every device! The retina images will be generated for you automatically (though you can also do it manually) and served to the retina devices. The concept of retina images for full-size images is also a very unique feature which is only provided by this plugin (which is why it became unique).

**Retina Methods**. It supports different methods to serve the images to your visitors. Why? Depending on the theme and plugins you are using (and also the way you use images in your website), not all the methods can work. Ideally, I would recommend using the Responsive Images method, then if it doesn't work, the PictureFill method (which covers normally most cases). RetinaJS should be the fallback method. The methods available are: PictureFill (future HTML standard + its JS polyfill), Responsive Images (only use the src-set created internally by WP 4.4+), Retina.js (JS only), IMG Rewrite (on-the-fly HTML rewrite) and Retina-Images (server handler). A lazy-loading option is available as well (works with PicturFill and Responsive Images). Pick the one that works best with your hosting and WordPress environment.

**Plug & Play**. With a well-made theme and website, this plugin doesn't require normally any specific set-up. All the defaults settings are fine. Works with multi-site and many kinds of installs.

**Optimized**. The plugin is very fast and optimized. It doesn't create anything in the database. In most cases, it doesn't even require any configuration.

**WP 4.4+**. Since WordPress 4.4, there is support for Responsive Images. WP Retina 2x handles this well and nicely adds the retina images in the src-set created by WordPress. The HTML for the images not handled by WP 4.4 will also be handled by the plugin. Moreover, the plugin also has two options specific to WP 4.4+. One is to disable the Responsive Image support, the second one is to disable the additional image size called Medium Large.

**CSS & Background Images**. The plugin can't add retina support to your CSS (that would be too dangerous), and therefore your CSS background images. If your themes or plugins are using them heavily, you can contact the developer and kindly ask to use WP Retina 2x API to add retina support to those background images (that is possible this way). A few gallery and slider plugins are using CSS background images.

= Quickstart =

1. Set your option (for instance, you probably don't need retina images for every sizes set-up in your WP).
2. Generate the retina images (required only the first time, then images are generated automatically).
3. Check if it works! - if it doesn't, read the FAQ, the tutorial, and check the forums.
